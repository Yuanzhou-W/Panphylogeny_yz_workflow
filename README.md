# Comparative_genomics-project_for_prokaryote
This currently serves as a working log for the project and may potentially evolve into a standalone analysis pipeline. It chronicles activities from January 2023 to the present, focusing on leveraging publicly available databases for metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, genomic, and other omics data. The analyses incorporate various tools and platforms such as anvio and InStrain, conducting comparative genomics, pangenomics, and environmental genomics studies. The primary objective is to investigate genomic variations at the species and subspecies levels within prokaryotic genomes and identify genomic features associated with environmental phenotypes.
